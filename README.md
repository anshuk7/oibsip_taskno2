This is a Java project which I made in internship task of Oasis Infobyte "Number Guessing Game".


Description: The "Number Guessing Game" is an enjoyable and straightforward Java project that allows the user to guess a number generated by the computer.

It involves the following steps:
The program generates a random number within a given range, for example, between 1 and 100.
The user is prompted to enter their guess through a displayed dialogue box.
The program provides feedback on whether the entered number matches the generated number or if it is higher or lower.
The game continues as the user keeps guessing the number, with the program providing feedback after each guess.

Additional Features:
The project includes a limitation on the number of attempts the user can make.
Multiple rounds can be played, adding an element of challenge and variety to the game.
The program keeps track of the score, displaying it to the user.
Points are awarded based on the number of attempts taken, encouraging players to guess the number in fewer attempts for a higher score.
